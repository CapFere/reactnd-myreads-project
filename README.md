# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. All the Rubrics for the project have been fullfilled and ready to be tested on local machine.

## TL;DR

To run the project localy right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
